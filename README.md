Log Analyzer Intrusion Detection System (GUI-Based)
Project Description:
This project implements a GUI-based Log Analyzer Intrusion Detection System designed to detect suspicious login attempts and brute-force attacks by analyzing server access logs.
It processes HTTP access logs, identifies repeated failed login attempts (HTTP 401), calculates attack severity using time-window analysis, and generates visual and textual incident reports.
> Features:
✅ Access log parsing (access.log)
✅ Brute-force attack detection
✅ Time-window based correlation
✅ Severity classification (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
✅ Incident & alert report generation
✅ Graphical visualization of attacks
✅ Tkinter-based GUI
✅ Whitelist IP support
